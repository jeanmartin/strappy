h1. Strappy

Bootstrap a Rails 2.3 app with a template

h2. What does this thing have in it

  * Haml 2.1
  * Haml views
  * Sass stylesheets
  * jQuery 1.3
  * jQueryUI 1.7
  * Blackbird for UI debugging
  * CC.rb rake task
  * Capistrano with Staging and Production environments
  * A defualt 'home' controller in place of index.html
  * A strappy rake task to install commonly used plugins, lifted from Bort and modified

Admittedly this thing kind of steps out side of the box in what I believe they
intended application templates to do by bringing in controllers and specs.

h3. Gems

  * GemTools to manage gems and versions
  * SiteConfig to manage the app congiguration
  * RSpec for testing
  * Rcov to help make sure you are testing
  * WillPaginate for pagination
  * ExposeModel to tidy up your controllers and views
  * FriendlyID for pretty URLs

h3. Installed plugins

  * jRails to handle jQuery
  * CoreExtensions, just a bunch of common hacks I find myself using
  * uberkit to make forms less painful

h3. Plugins available through rake strappy:install

  * acts_as_configurable
  * acts_as_list
  * acts_as_rated
  * acts_as_solr
  * acts_as_taggable_on_steroids
